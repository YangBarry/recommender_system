Among available datasets we focus on two of them, **5-core** and **metadata**. **5-core** is a subset of the complete reviews data in which all users and items have at least 5 reviews. And **metadata** is the complete information dataset of items. Our main goal is to utilize the information of reviews, items and users if any, to establish a recommender system, which is expected to make appropriate recommendation for users.\n",
