# recommender_system
This is a collaboration project with Peilin Liu and Guang Yang on a recommender systems. We propose a deep recommender system for Amazon. The designed neural network calculates the degree of matching between any pair of user and product given multimodal data, which composes the core computing part of a large-scale recommender system.
